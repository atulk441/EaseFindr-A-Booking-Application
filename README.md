# EaseFindr-A-Booking-Application

# **Abstract:** <br> 
In today’s world, where technology is advancing at a high pace, the need for user-friendly and efficient apps has become more crucial than ever before. And the users of today’s application want the application (that they use) to be effective in terms of everything will be available at their fingertips. Despite the millions of applications available to us today, many of them fail to provide a good user experience. This bad user experience can be due to a number of reasons such as poor design, unclear instructions etcetera, which cause inconvenience for the users. So, keeping all these points in mind, I have developed an application which helps improve the usability of an application through its UI, proper navigation, and clear instructions. The application is developed for booking taxis, hotel rooms, and flights, and ticked for events. So, everything will be contained within one application and with just in few clicks the user can book anything he would need with multiple options.
